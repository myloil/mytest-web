Create React App is the best way to start building a new React single page application. It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 6 on your machine.

npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-app

cd my-app

npm start

If you have npm 5.2.0+ installed, you may use npx instead.

npx create-react-app my-app

cd my-app

npm start
